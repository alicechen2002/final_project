# While the World Bank uses GNI per capita, this analysis uses GDP per capita.
# Furthermore, the World Bank uses US$, converted from local currencies using
# the World Bank-specific Atlas method, whereas this representation uses
# International Dollars. Each international dollar would buy, in the respective
# country, a comparable amount of goods and services a U.S. dollar would buy in
# the United States. This is to account for Purchasing Power Parity.

# As of July 1, 2020, the bounds are: low (<$1036), lower-middle (1036-4045),
# upper-middle (4046-12535), and high (> 12535)

# high-income countries, using a similar method used by the World Bank.
